## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Gold (#FFD700) to evoke a sense of fantasy and classic aesthetics.
- Background color: Dark lead grey (a desaturated, very dark grey) to ensure legibility.
- Accent color: Emerald green (#50C878) to add a touch of mystique and fantasy, drawing inspiration from the mention of emerald in the user's request.
- Body text and headlines: 'Literata', serif. Use Literata's vintage, literary feel to evoke the aesthetic of a mystical codex, as requested by the user.
- Utilize SVG alqu√≠micos (e.g., mercury, air, water) to represent different aspects of the generated nation.
- Design the UI to resemble a mystical codex, with parchment-like textures and decorative elements.
- Implement subtle parchment-style animations, with symbols flowing smoothly, to add a magical and dynamic feel to the interface.
